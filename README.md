## Welcome to My To-Do App Project!

- Here you will find the HTML, CSS and JavaScript for my project.

- When you open the html file you will see it is very easy and efficient to use. 

- You can add your name at the top left hand corner.

- You can type in your To-Do's and add them.

- Select whether or not it is for School or Work and Personal use.

- You can edit your To-Do.

- You can delete it as well.

- And if you are done with your To-Do, simply click the small radio/bubble button on the left of it to cross it out to show that   you have completed it.

- It will also show up alphabetically when you hit refresh.

- And you will also see that when you do, all your To-Do's will remain there as it is saved to your local storage.
